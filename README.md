# Bus-Incident-Indicator

All files are in Preliminary as we are still in the planning phase.

Credit to NYC Open Data for creating an open dataset so large it can used in a project like this.
Credit to Professor Jefferson Bien-Aime for helping me thoughout the project.

### Project Goals

This project aims at using the data to predict and provide BI solutions on bus incidents of the United States.

Currently, we are looking at an application-like product where the user can do the following:
  Type a code to get information on a specific incident
  Have a live BI interface of incidents
  Provide predicitive information on why the bus is late and what the cause could be.

The project is divided into two sections: a planning phase and technical phase.

The planning phase is meant to ensure we have all aspects done correctly to model a proper data warehouse.
The technical phase will construct the data warehouse and perform the operations of the project goals.
