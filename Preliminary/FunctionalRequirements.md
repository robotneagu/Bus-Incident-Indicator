### 1.	Have a 5-day records separate database that clearly outlines to the user what were the most common issues for a school bus to be late when arriving and departing. This should be easily accessible for the user and may include a BI interface.
### 2.	Create a probability calculator, also easily accessible, that determines based on your location and school location if any issues will arise from the bus end.
### 3.	Create a graph easily accessible and legible to show trends based on a specific filter such as weather or time or day.
### 4.	For common reasons of being late, an indication should be sent out stating that the child will experience a delay coming to/from home.
